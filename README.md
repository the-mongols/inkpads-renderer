A monorepo of tools primarily used to render .wowsreplay files. Interacting with World of Warships game data, replays, and assets, a Discord bot has been setup to accept single and dual-renders of .wowsreplay files for common users, as well as KOTS-level of refereeing and broadcasting. Heatmaps for data visualization are underway as well, looking to provide KOTS broadcasts with interesting and usable stats, visualizations, and assets. A live markup (drawing tools) are underway via a webUI portal for similar purposes. 

**Developed by The_Mongols, built upon the foundation of the wows-toolkit, wowsunpack, wows-replays, minimap-renderer, and replayshark community projects.**



## Quick Start: Discord Bot

If you just want to get the Discord bot up and running:

1. **Run Setup**: Execute `setup_bot.bat` (Windows). This will install dependencies and create your `.env` file.
2. **Configure**: Open `inkpads-bot/.env` and paste your Discord Bot Token.
3. **Launch**: Run `python inkpads-bot/bot.py`.

For more detailed instructions, see the [Bot README](inkpads-bot/README.md).

## Demo Assets

High-fidelity `.mov` recordings and screenshots demonstrating the Discord bot's intake and the renderer's output (including single and dual-view sync) can be found in the [`assets/demos/`](assets/demos/) directory.
